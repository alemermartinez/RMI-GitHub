\usage{
margint.cl(Xp, yp, point = NULL, windows, epsilon = 1e-06, prob = NULL,
  type = "0", degree = NULL, qderivate = FALSE, orderkernel = 2,
  Qmeasure = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xp}{Matrix of explanatory variables (n by p).}

\item{yp}{Vector of responses (missing values are allowed).}

\item{point}{Matrix of points where predictions will be computed and returned.}

\item{windows}{Vector or a squared matrix of bandwidths for the smoothing estimation procedure.}

\item{epsilon}{Convergence criterion.}

\item{prob}{Probabilities of observing each response (n). Defaults to ``NULL''.}

\item{type}{Three different type of estimators can be selected: type '0' (local constant on all the covariates), type '1' (local linear smoother on all the covariates), type 'alpha' (local polynomial smoother only on the direction of interest).}

\item{degree}{Degree of the local polynomial smoother in the direction of interest when using the estimator of type 'alpha'. Defaults to ``NULL'' for the case when using estimators of type '0' or '1'.}

\item{qderivate}{If TRUE, it calculates g^(q+1)/(q+1)! for each component only for the type 'alpha' method. Defaults to ``FALSE''.}

\item{orderkernel}{Order of the kernel used in the nuisance directions when using the estimator of type 'alpha'. Defaults to ``2''.}

\item{Qmeasure}{A matrix of points where the integration procedure ocurrs. Defaults to ``NULL'' for calcuting the integrals over the sample.}
}
\value{
\item{mu}{Estimate for the intercept.}
\item{g.matrix}{Matrix of estimated additive components (n by p).} 
\item{prediction }{Matrix of estimated additive components for the points listed in the argument point.}
\item{mul}{A vector of size p showing in each component the estimated intercept that considers only that direction of interest when using the type 'alpha' method.}
\item{g.derivative }{Matrix of estimated derivatives of the additive components (only when qderivate is ``TRUE'') (n by p).}
\item{prediction.derivate }{Matrix of estimated derivatives of the additive components for the points listed in the argument point (only when qderivate is ``TRUE'').}
