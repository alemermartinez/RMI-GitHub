\arguments{
  \item{Xp}{Matrix of explanatory variables (n by p).
%%     ~~Describe \code{Xp} here~~
}
  \item{yp}{Vector of responses (missing values are allowed).
%%     ~~Describe \code{yp} here~~
}
  \item{point}{Matrix of points where predictions will be computed and returned. 
%%     ~~Describe \code{point} here~~
}
  \item{windows}{Vector or a squared matrix of bandwidths for the smoothing 
estimation procedure. 
%%     ~~Describe \code{windows} here~~
}
  \item{epsilon}{Convergence criterion.
%%     ~~Describe \code{epsilon} here~~
}
  \item{prob}{Probabilities of observing each response (n). Defaults to ``NULL'' and
in that case it is ignored.
%%     ~~Describe \code{prob} here~~
}
  \item{type}{Three different type of estimators can be selected: type '0' (local constant
on all the covariates), type '1' (local linear smoother on all the covariates), type 'alpha'
(local polynomial smoother only on the direction of interest).
}
  \item{degree}{Degree of the local polynomial smoother in the direction of interest
when using the estimator of type 'alpha'. Defaults to ``NULL'' for the case when using 
estimators of type '0' or '1'.
%%     ~~Describe \code{degree} here~~
}
  \item{orderkernel}{Order of the kernel used in the nuisance directions when 
using the estimator of type 'alpha'. Defaults to ``2''.
}
  \item{qderivate}{If TRUE, it calculates g^(q+1)/(q+1)! for each component only 
for the type 'alpha' method. Defaults to ``FALSE''.
}
  \item{Qmeasure}{A matrix of points where the integration procedure ocurrs. Defaults
to ``NULL'' for calcuting the integrals over the sample.
}
